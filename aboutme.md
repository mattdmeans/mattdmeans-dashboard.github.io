Hello! I'm Matt and I'm a data scientist familiar with the gathering, mining, and organizing of data for the use of technical and non-technical work. Proficient understanding of statistical, algebraic, and other analytical techniques. 

* I studied data science at Lambda School in 2020 and am now entering the workforce. 

* I was born and raised in Portland, OR and love everything that the Pacific Northwest has to offer.

* I enjoy diving into data to seperate the singal from the noise across a wide range of subjects.

* A quick learner, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge of the field and add new tools to my repetoire.
